## Chicago Crime Analysis
### Overview
This project explores crime data in Chicago from 2015 to 2022, focusing on data visualization and analysis to uncover trends and patterns in criminal activities.

### Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of crime numbers over time
- Analysis of crime types and their proportions
- Crime distribution across different districts and community areas
- Investigation of arrest rates across districts

### Tools and Technologies
- MATLAB for data visualization and analysis
- Python for data preprocessing and cleaning

### Insights
- Crime numbers have shown a relatively steady trend with a noticeable drop during the pandemic years.
- Theft, battery, and criminal damage are the most prevalent types of crimes.
- Crime distribution is more concentrated in central areas of Chicago.
- Arrest rates vary significantly across districts, indicating potential issues in law enforcement efficiency.

## Isle Royale Wolf-Moose Population Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes the population dynamics of wolves and moose on Isle Royale, exploring the relationships between predator and prey populations and environmental factors.

### Key Features
- Data cleaning and creation of codebooks
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of population trends and environmental variables
- Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation
- Linear regression and classification models to predict population dynamics

### Tools and Technologies
- Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn

### Insights
- There is a moderate negative linear relationship between kill rate and wolf population.
- Moose have a shorter lifespan on Isle Royale compared to their natural lifespan, likely due to predation and harsh environmental conditions.
- Moose number is positively correlated with wolves number and kill rate, and negatively correlated with predation rate and moose recruitment rate.
- Classification models can predict wolves number based on year, moose number, and kill rate with reasonable accuracy.

### Files

- wolf_moose_yearly.csv: Dataset containing yearly counts of wolf and moose populations.
- moose_deaths.csv: Dataset containing information about moose deaths.

## Point Cloud Processing using Point Feature Histograms
### Overview
This project introduces optimizations to the traditional Point Feature Histogram (PFH) method for point cloud alignment, enhancing its efficiency and scalability for real-time applications and large-scale datasets.

### Key Features
- Implementation of the PFH method with optimizations such as fast PFH computation, flattened histograms, logarithmic-scaled queries, adaptive filtering, and improved ICP recalculations
- Evaluation of different optimization techniques on point clouds of varying sizes
- Application to real-life room scan data

### Tools and Technologies
- Python for algorithm implementation and optimization
- Visualization tools for point cloud alignment

### Insights
- Optimized PFH algorithms significantly reduce computational complexity and improve alignment accuracy.
- Adaptive filtering techniques enhance robustness to noise and improve processing speed.
- The improved ICP method achieves high-precision alignment suitable for complex objects.
